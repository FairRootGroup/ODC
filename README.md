# Online Device Control

## Introduction
The Online Device Control project control/communicate with a graph (topology) of [FairMQ](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ) devices using [DDS](http://dds.gsi.de) or PMIx (under development)

The project containes a library and several executables:
  * The core library `odc-core-lib`.
  * The gRPC server `odc-grpc-server` is a sample implementation of the server based on the `odc-core-lib`.
  * The gRPC client `odc-grpc-client` is a sample implementation of client.
  * The CLI server `odc-cli-server` is another sample implementation of the server which doesn't require gRPC installation.

Communication between `odc-grpc-server` and `odc-grpc-client` is done via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The interface of the `odc-grpc-server` is described in the [odc.proto](grpc-proto/odc.proto) file.

## 3-rd party dependencies

  * [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
  * [DDS](http://dds.gsi.de)
  * [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
  * [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
  * [FairMQ](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ)
  * [FairLogger](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairLogger)

For macOS we recommend to install gRPC via `brew` which also installs `Protobuf` and other dependencies:
```bash
brew install grpc
```

## Installation form source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FairRootGroup/ODC
cd ODC
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[INSTALL_DIR] ..
make install
```

If dependencies are not installed in standard system directories, you can hint the installation location via `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=...` or per dependency via `-D{DEPENDENCY}_ROOT=...`. `{DEPENDENCY}` can be `BOOST`, `DDS`, `Protobuf`, `gRPC`, `FairMQ`, `FairLogger` (`*_ROOT` variables can also be environment variables).

## Installation with aliBuild

Alternatively, ODC and 3-rd party dependencies can be installed using [aliBuild](https://github.com/alisw/alibuild):

```
> mkdir INSTALL_DIR
> cd INSTALL_DIR
> git clone https://github.com/alisw/alidist.git
> aliBuild --default odc build ODC
```

## Usage
Start the gRPC server in foreground:
```bash
export PATH=[INSTALL_DIR]/bin:$PATH
odc-grpc-server
```

Start the sample gRPC client in a different terminal:
```bash
export PATH=[INSTALL_DIR]/bin:$PATH
odc-grpc-client
```

Alternatively, if gRPC is not installed, start CLI server in foreground:
```bash
export PATH=[INSTALL_DIR]/bin:$PATH
odc-cli-server
```

By default this example uses [localhost plugin](http://dds.gsi.de/doc/nightly/RMS-plugins.html#localhost-plugin) of [DDS](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS) and a topology which is installed in `INSTALL_DIR/share/odc/ex-dds-topology-infinite.xml`.

The standard sequence of requests:
```
.init
.submit
.activate
.config
.start
.stop
.reset
.term
.down
.quit
```

Alternatively, start the server as a background daemon (in your user session):

Linux:
```bash
# After installation, execute once
systemctl --user daemon-reload
# Then control odc-grpc-server via
systemctl --user start/stop/status odc-service
# View server logs
journalctl --user-unit odc-service [-f]
```

MacOS:
```bash
# TODO Someone on a mac verify this or correct, and find out where logs end up
# See https://www.launchd.info/. Also, I guess there are GUIs on Mac to do this too?
launchctl load/unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/de.gsi.odc.plist
launchctl start/stop de.gsi.odc-grpc-server
```

Find more details on the usage of the `systemctl`/`launchctl` commands in the manpages
of your system.

More examples can be found [here](examples).
